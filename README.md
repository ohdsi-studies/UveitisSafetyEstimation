This study applied validity diagnostics on a heterogeneous, observational study setting to answer a specific safety research question. The results indicated that safety effect estimates from many analyses would be inappropriate to interpret as causal, given the data available and methods employed. Validity diagnostics should always be used to determine if the design and analysis are of sufficient quality to support causal inferences.
